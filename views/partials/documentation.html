  <p>Each of these variables holds an object with important information to help you determine the winner of the game. You can reference the stat you want by using the "dot notation", like <code>team1.losses</code> or <code>team1.win_pct</code> or <code>game.round</code>.</p>

  <div class='subtitle'>Writing the function</div>
  <ul>
    <li>The game picking function definition should look like this: <code>function (game, team1, team2) {}</code></li>
    <li>To indicate a team's win, call the function: <code>team1.winsGame()</code> or <code>team2.winsGame()</code></li>
    <li>To give both team1 and team2 a chance to win, make sure both teams have their respective <code>winsGame()</code> function called at some point in your logic.</li>
  </ul>
